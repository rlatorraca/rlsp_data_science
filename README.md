# Data Science & Computer Vision Learning Portfolio

Welcome!  
This repository documents my learning journey in **Data Science** and **Computer Vision**, where I apply theory through hands-on projects and continuous experimentation.

---

### 👋 About Me

I am currently expanding my skills in data-driven development, building on prior experience as a Full Stack Engineer working with enterprise applications and cloud environments. My focus now is on learning how to create meaningful insights and intelligent systems using **Python**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning techniques**.

This portfolio reflects my growth, curiosity, and commitment to continuous improvement.

### 🎯 Learning Focus

- **Data Analysis & Exploration**  
  Working with real-world datasets to extract insights and understand patterns.

- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**  
  Model training, evaluation, tuning, and interpretation.

- **Computer Vision**  
  Image processing, feature extraction, and deep learning models for visual understanding.

- **End-to-End Projects**  
  From data sourcing → processing → modeling → visualization or deployment.
